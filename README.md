# Website_Library_System

Design of website with the following description, using vue.js:

The library of a small town needs your help to design a website and app to support their users. The library provides its community with access to books, movies, and music albums — all in physical form. The library would like the users to be able to browse the available titles, reserve them, and then pick them up afterwards. Some items such as newspapers and an archive can also be browsed, but not reserved or checked out. Users can checkout items for a specific period, after which the item must be either renewed or returned. In addition, the library can be used for events and booked by members of the community.


The user base is anyone living in the small town who can create a free account. Users can use the website or app to create this account, or they can ask a librarian to create an account for them. Users can choose whether they have an online account or not. If they have an online account, they must use a username/password, and provide an email address. If a user signs up with a librarian, then no username/password or email is required. All users must provide their full names and residential address, and they are issued a library card that contains a unique ID number. Users with local addresses that have been verified can access all the library resources for free. Citizens who live outside the small town can also use the library’s services, however, they must pay a small fee.


The library is managed by a head-librarian who is assisted by several librarians. The head-librarian has all the privileges of a librarian in addition to a couple more. They can hire and fire librarians, assign them schedules, and decide the opening hours/days of the library.
